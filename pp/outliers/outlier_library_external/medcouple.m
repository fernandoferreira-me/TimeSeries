function [mc] = medcouple(x)
%
% 'medcouple' computes the medcouple measure, a robust measure of skewness
% for a skewed distribution. It takes into account cases where the
% observations are equal to the median of the series.
%
% Data in 'x' are organized so that columns are the time series and rows
% are the time intervals. All series contain the same number of
% observations.
%
% [mc] = medcouple(x) returns the following:
% mc    - vector with the medcouple measure of the data series
